#summary How to use the libksnd music player library

 * See [http://code.google.com/p/klystron/source/browse/trunk/src/lib/ksnd.h ksnd.h] for the API.
 * Link with libksnd.a for DLL use (needs ksnd.dll)
 * Link with libksndstatic.a for static use (no external dlls needed) - note: you need to link with winmm since it uses Windows waveout stuff
 * You can also include the song as data and use {{{KSND_LoadSongFromMemory()}}} to load the song
 * For VS users: use the .def file to create a .lib from the DLL in case you need it. 

Song loading and playing should be straightforward. See example below:

{{{
#include "ksnd.h"
#include <windows.h>

// Plays Test.kt from the beginning for 10 seconds, pauses for 1 second
// and after unpausing frees allocated stuff and exits.

int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, PSTR pCmdLine, int nCmdShow)
{
	KPlayer *player;
	KSong * song;
	
	player = KSND_CreatePlayer(44100);
	
	song = KSND_LoadSong(player, "Test.kt");
	
	KSND_PlaySong(player, song, 0);
	
	Sleep(10000);
	
	KSND_Pause(player, 1);
	
	Sleep(1000);
	
	KSND_Pause(player, 0);
	
	Sleep(10000);
		
	KSND_FreePlayer(player);
	KSND_FreeSong(song);
		
	return 0;
}
}}}

Static linking:

{{{
gcc player.c -o player -lksndstatic -lwinmm
}}}

Dynamic linking:

{{{
gcc player.c -o player -lksnd
