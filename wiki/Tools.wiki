#summary List of tools used to create content for klystron

= Tools =

Since klystron uses own file formats and data structures, custom tools are provided in the _tools/_ directory. 

== makebundle ==

_makebundle_ is used to bundle multiple files in one klystron data container (called a [Bundle bundle]). E.g. a font is a bundle of an image file and a text file with the character map. The bundles can be accessed in random fashion. The bundle can contain more bundles. 

For example, klystron font is a bundle of the following directory structure:

{{{
fontdata/charmap.txt
fontdata/font.bmp
}}}

The actual bundle is created with makebundle as follows:

{{{
makebundle font.fnt fontdata
}}}

This bundles all files in the directory _fontdata_ as _font.fnt_. The font could then, for example, be bundled inside a larger bundle containing all game data.
